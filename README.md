## Model Comparison Table

| Model                | Architecture   | Parameters (Millions) |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| VoxelMorph           | CNN            | 0.27                  |
| ViT-V-Net            | Transformer    | 31.33                 |
| TransMorph           | Transformer    | 46.75                 |
| **Proposed NestedMorph**      | **Transformer**    | **19.75**                |

‚≠ê The proposed **NestedMorph** is at least **57% less in size** than the current state-of-the-art Transformer models.

## Key Features  
- **3D Deformable Image Registration:** Designed for volumetric medical images to capture complex anatomical variations.  
- **Attention-Based Architecture:** Utilizes multi-scale attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and alignment.  
- **Spatial Transformer Integration:** Efficient warping of source images based on predicted deformation fields.  
- **Flexible Training:** Supports various loss functions (similarity metrics, regularization losses) and datasets.  
- **Optimized Input Size:** The study utilized images of size **64x64x64**, ensuring efficient training and inference.  

## Overall Framework  

The **Overall Framework** for NestedMorph combines multiple modules that work in synergy for medical image registration. The framework consists of the following key components:
- **Image Preprocessing:** Includes normalization, resizing, and augmentation of medical images.
- **Model Architecture:** Based on a Vision Transformer-based model with nested attention for improved feature extraction and registration accuracy.
- **Loss Functions:** Designed to optimize for both similarity metrics and geometric consistency between the source and target images.

## Model Architecture  
NestedMorph comprises:  
1. **Feature Extractor (Multi-Scale Encoder):** Extracts multi-scale features from input image pairs.
2. **Nested Attention Module:** Captures both local and global dependencies for enhanced feature aggregation.
3. **Decoder:** Refines and reconstructs the deformation field for precise alignment.
4. **Flow Estimation (Conv3D):** Predicts the deformation field for aligning the images.  
5. **Spatial Transformer:** Applies the deformation field to warp the source image.  

The model outputs:  
- **Registered Image:** The warped version of the source image, aligned to the target.  
- **Deformation Field:** Encodes the spatial transformation required for alignment.

- [CycleMorph](src/models/cyclemorph/cycleMorph_model.py) - A model for cycle-consistent registration.
- [MIDIR](src/models/midir/midir.py) - Multi-scale Image Deformable Registration.
- [TransMorph](src/models/transmorph/TransMorph.py) - Transformer-based registration model.
- [ViT-V-Net](src/models/vitvnet/vitvnet.py) - Vision Transformer-based network for medical image registration.
- [VoxelMorph](src/models/voxelmorph.py) - A voxel-based deformable registration method.
- [NestedMorph](src/models/nestedmorph.py) - Proposed Nested multi-scale deformable model.

## Data Directory Structure  

The `data/` directory is structured as follows to organize training and testing datasets for deformable medical image registration:

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subject2_t1.pkl         # Pickle files containing source images (e.g., T1 image for subject 2)

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subject2_dwi.pkl        # Pickle files containing target images (e.g., DWI image for subject 2)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

- **T1_Moving/**: Contains the source images for registration. These could be T1-weighted MRI scans or any other type of image used as the "moving" image.
- **Diffusion_Fixed/**: Contains the target images for registration. These could be Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) scans or any other type of image used as the "fixed" image.

Each `subjectID_t1.pkl` file should match a corresponding `subjectID_dwi.pkl` file for proper pairing in the registration tasks.
